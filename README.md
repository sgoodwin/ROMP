#ROMP
This is the public beta for the read-only music player for Mac, ROMP.

As this is a beta, you may find things don't always work as expected, but I'll be continuing efforts to make ROMP into a nice player.

(Since this is brand new, I haven't setup auto-updating, so you'll need to check back here for new releases later.)

# Read Only
ROMP has read-only access to your music, enforced by the OS itself. It does not modify or rearrange your music, so you are free to try it out without data loss.

# File Support

ROMP has been tested with ogg-vorbis, MP3, M4A and FLAC files. Support for Opus and Ape files coming soon.

# Requests and Bugs
The Issues section of this project is public, so feel free to open an issue for problems you find.

# Future Plans
I'm still debating wether to make the whole app open source or publish the release version as a free app.

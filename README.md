#ROMP
This is the public beta for the read-only music player for Mac, ROMP.

As this is a beta, you may find things don't always work as expected, but I'll be continuing efforts to make ROMP into a nice player.

(Since this is brand new, I haven't setup auto-updating, so you'll need to check back here for new releases later.)

# Read Only
ROMP has read-only access to your music, enforced by the OS itself. It does not modify or rearrange your music, so you are free to try it out without data loss.

# File Support

ROMP has been tested with ogg-vorbis, MP3, M4A and FLAC files. Support for Opus and Ape files coming soon.

# Live-monitoring Folders

Folders of music you add to ROMP are monitored, so any new music added to those folders will automatically be picked up by the app.

# Removable Media

Part of your music library can be on a removable drive or a network-accessed directory. If they are disconnected when you open ROMP, it will remove those tracks from the playable list, but soon as the volume is reconnected, ROMP will see that and add the tracks from this drive back.

# Requests and Bugs
The Issues section of this project is public, so feel free to open an issue for problems you find.

# Future Plans
I'm still debating wether to make the whole app open source or publish the release version as a free app.
